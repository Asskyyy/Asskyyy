# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

I am Alex, an aspiring game developer focused on combining creativity and technical skills to build engaging and meaningful gaming experiences. I am currently developing a pixel-art 2D RPG mobile game using the Godot engine, designed to facilitate English language learning for children and adults through gamified role-playing gameplay.

## Current Project
- **Project**: A pixel-art 2D RPG mobile game developed with Godot.  
  - **Theme**: Integrates English language fundamentals into an interactive role-playing experience suitable for all ages.  
  - **Features**: Gamified learning, narrative-driven gameplay, and pixel-art aesthetics.  
  - **Status**: In active development. Explore my repositories for more details.

## Goals
- Deepen expertise in Godot and expand to other game engines, such as Unity and Unreal Engine.  
- Utilize efficient and creative coding practices to streamline development processes.  
- Investigate the potential and limitations of AI in game development, particularly in design, testing, and content generation.  
- Create original games that blend education, entertainment, and innovation.

## Technical Skills and Tools
- **Current Stack**: Godot, GDScript, Pixel Art tools (e.g., Aseprite)  
- **Planned Learning**: Unity (C#), Unreal Engine (C++/Blueprints), AI-driven tools for game development  
- **Interests**: Gamified learning design, narrative development, 2D art

## About Me
- **Interests**: Game design, pixel art, English education, and exploring emerging technologies  
- **Philosophy**: Create games that make learning engaging and push the boundaries of creative expression.

## Collaboration
I am continuously learning and growing as a developer. Feel free to explore my repositories, provide feedback, or collaborate on projects. I am particularly interested in connecting with others passionate about game development, gamified learning, or AI applications in gaming.
